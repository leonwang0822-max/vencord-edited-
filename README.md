<summary>Using Vencord violates Discord's terms of service</summary>

Client modifications are against Discord's Terms of Service.

However, Discord is pretty indifferent about them and there are no known cases of users getting banned for using client mods! So you should generally be fine as long as you don't use any plugins that implement abusive behaviour. But no worries, all inbuilt plugins are safe to use!

Regardless, if your account is very important to you and it getting disabled would be a disaster for you, you should probably not use any client mods (not exclusive to Vencord), just to be safe.

Additionally, make sure not to post screenshots with Vencord in a server where you might get banned for it.
